Openkimtests
============

Directory Structure
-------------------

openkimtest
  * bin  - holds pipeline and other scripts
	* db.py - database stuff
	* filetools.py - list the good python files in a directory
	* kim.py - kim potential loader
	* lammps.py - lammps potential loader
	* logger.py - logging
	* pipeline.py - runs all of the scripts
	* potential.py - defines the potentials
 
  * docs - holds documentation automatically generated by doxygen once and a while
  * results - holds the result xml files from pipeline or -w runs
  * kim_tests - holds the tests
	* _BaseTest.py - the test all tests inherit
	* _MinimalTest.py - a minimal example
  * logs - holds the logs
	* openkimlog.log - the debug log
	* openkimg.warning.log - the warning log
	* test.log - the unittest log
  * unittests - some unittests

Tests
------

As for the tests:

So, the Tests will inherit from the BaseTest, which should be able to do most of
what is required of tests.

In order to write your own tests, just copy the NullTest.py file, rename the
file and the class name as desired, and write the TestResult method.


Test Usage:
-----------

usage: python NullTest.py [-h] [-v] [-w]
                   [potential] [element]

positional arguments:
  potential         The first argument is the potential
  element           The second argument is the element
  optional arguments    The remaining are optional

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -v, --verify      runs the verify method
  -w, --write       writes the xml file to the results directory


TODO:
-----
  O - Write the documentation
  O - get KIM potentials working
  O - get lammps potentials working
  O - get GPAW potential working
  O - write more tests

TESTS:    
------
    X  - FCC lattice constants
    O  - BCC lattice constants
    O  - verify forces are gradients
    O  - Figure out equilibrium structure
    O  - Vacancy formation energy
    O  - Vacancy displacement field
    O  - hexagonal lattice constants
    O  - Elastic Moduli
    O  - maybe verify the lattice constants (see that force is zero)
    O  - unit change test.
    O  - change potential parameters, perhaps make a LennardJones potential
