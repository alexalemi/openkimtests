This is the directory for housing all of our OpenKIM tests

Directory Structure

openkimtest
    -bin  - holds pipeline and other scripts
    -docs - holds documentation automatically generated by doxygen once and a while
    -outputs - holds the commandline outputs from pipeline runs
    -results - holds the result xml files from pipeline or -w runs
    -test - holds the test
    -verify - holds results of verifications during pipeline runs (not working yet)


As for the tests:

So, the Tests will inherit from the BaseTest, which should be able to do most of
what is required of tests.

In order to write your own tests, just copy the NullTest.py file, rename the
file and the class name as desired, and write the TestResult method.
