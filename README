This is the directory for housing all of our OpenKIM tests

Tests go in the tests folder.

bin houses some parent files and scripts

results contains the results of the test runs

verify contains the results of the verify runs



So, the Tests will inherit from the BaseTest, which should be able to do most of
what is required of tests


TODO:
    X  - XML writing
    O  - argparsing
    O  - simple pipeline
    O  - unit test the Tests
    
    
    
As for the XML structure, possible structure

<Test name='FCCLattice'>
    <Config>
        <Potential>PotentialName</Potential>
        <Element> ElementSymbol </Element>
    </Config>
    <Results>
        <LatticeConstant> value </LatticeConstant>
        <LatticeEnergy>  value </LatticeEnergy>
    </Results>
</Test>
