This is the directory for housing all of our OpenKIM tests

Tests go in the tests folder.

bin houses some parent files and scripts, as well as future pipeline scripts, and
    some unittests for the atomic tests.

results contains the results of the test runs

verify contains the results of the verify runs


So, the Tests will inherit from the BaseTest, which should be able to do most of
what is required of tests.

In order to write your own tests, just copy the NullTest.py file, rename the
file and the class name as desired, and write the TestResult method.
